A modular Python implementation for cleaning and normalizing unstructured text data. This toolkit provides a robust pipeline to transform raw text into a format suitable for downstream machine learning tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling.

## Key Functionalities
- **Text Normalization:** Case folding, Unicode normalization, and whitespace stripping.
- **Noise Reduction:** Automated removal of HTML tags, URLs, and special characters using Regex.
- **Linguistic Processing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, and Lemmatization (via NLTK/SpaCy).
- **Data Export:** Support for CSV and JSON output formats.
